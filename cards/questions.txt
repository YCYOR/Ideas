JavaScript

1. What are the levels of scope in JS?
   Global scope for a var exists when a var is defined at the top level, i.e. outside of any function. Inside of a function definition, a var would be said to have local scope, i.e. within the funciton itself. A function defined inside another function closes over its parent's scope, creating a closure. There is also object scope for properties defined on an object, as well a prototype scope for properties defined on an object's prototype. In ES6, the LET keyword defines lexical scope.

2. Is JavaScript multithreaded or single threaded?
   JavaScipt is single threaded.

3. what are 'built in' types in JS?
   Built in types are defined in the JavaScript language itself, for instance: strings, numbers and bolleans. Other objects are created by defining objects. Strings, numbers and booleans, have properties and functions but are not objects. You can create new properties on them but these properties are "lost", e.g. var a = foo; foo.bar = 23; foo.bar // undefined.

4. Define a few patterns of inheritance in JS?
   Prototypal inheritance is different from object-oriented inheritance where objects from other objects. In JavaScript, every object has a prototype property which can be inheritied by way of that object's constructor method. An object's prototype property can also be set explicitly.

5. Explain a few ways of writing asynchronous JS?
   AJAX is one way of writing asynchronous JavaScript. AJAX uses the XMLHttpRequest(XHR) .

6. Can JavaScript run in any other environment other than browser?
   Yes; most notably there is the node.js environment for running JavaScript languages independently of the browser.

7. Is JS compiled language?
   Yes, modern JavaScript is compiled into byte code and then into machine language. Originally, it was interpreted.

8. Why do we say java script is a dynamic language?
   Because JavaScript variables may point to any object or built-in datatype. For instance, var a = 'foo'; a = new Date(); is valid JavaScript, even if it is not good practice.

 

 Angular

 1. What is the difference between compile and link?
   Linking is a function that registers DOM listeners and updates the DOM. Compile is the process where an HTML string or DOM is transformed into a template and then produces a template function. Linking occurs after the templates have been compiled and cloned.

 2. What is injector in angular?
   Injectors are part of Angular's Dependency Injection system. It is responsible for creating and providing components and providing them to other components. Dependency Injection is a pattern that facilitates de-coupling in software.

 3. What is the difference between factory, service and provider in angularjs?
   Services return an instance of their function. Services return the value of their defining function. Providers return the function.$get method and have the ability to configured in the module's configuration.

 4, what is a directive and why it is used?
   A directive is a way of creating new behavior into an Angular app in an encapsulated way. They are used to inject new features in a reusable way, directly in the markup, without the user(consumer) of the directive having to know any JavaScript.

 5. What is $apply and $digest? How they are used in angular?
   

 6. What are modules in angularjs

 7. How data binding works in angular and what is scope?

 8. How to approach unit testing for angularjs components?
